    <h2>Why does this site exist?</h2>
    
    <p>Great, yet another site with articles about software development. Why? That's a very fair question. Allow me to explain...</p>

    <img class="inlineimage" src="./img/corporate1.png">
    <p>There are many different types of people who develop software, and their
        needs are very different. A bare-bones solution may be adequate for a small business,
        but may be seriously deficient for a large multinational corporation. Add in other
        types of groups, such as nonprofits, governmental organizations, hobbyists, and others,
        and the audience becomes vast. Within that vastness, there's a need for specialization.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this site is to:
        <p class="callout">Provide context and insights
        into the issues and challenges surrounding Enterprise Software Development.</p>
        <p>So while some technologies have massive
        applicability to startups, or small businesses, or even "lone wolf open source" projects,
        this site will consider the issues that most impact the enterprise software developer.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>What's an Enterprise?</h2>
    <p>Okay, so what exactly is an enterprise software developer? And before that, what do you mean
        by an Enterprise?</p>

    <p>According to ChatGPT<sup>*</sup>, "An enterprise, in the context of business and economics, typically
        refers to a large and complex organization or corporation engaged in commercial, industrial,
        or professional activities. Enterprises are characterized by their size, scope, and structure,
        and they can encompass a wide range of industries and sectors.
        <ul>
            <li>Enterprises are structured organizations with defined hierarchies, departments, and
                specialized roles. They often have various levels of management, including executives,
                managers, and employees, organized to efficiently operate and manage the business.</li>
            <li>Enterprises often have a significant presence in the markets they serve. They may
                have a large customer base, brand recognition, and a wide geographic reach, potentially
                operating on a national or global scale.</li>
            <li>Due to their size and scope, enterprises typically require substantial resources,
                including financial capital, human resources, infrastructure, and technology, to
                support their operations.</li>
            <li>Enterprises typically have well-defined strategic goals and objectives aimed at
                achieving long-term growth, profitability, and sustainability. These goals often guide
                their decision-making processes and investments.</li>
            <li>Given their size and complexity, enterprises often have comprehensive risk management
                practices in place to identify, assess, and mitigate various risks that could impact
                their operations, reputation, or financial stability.</li>
            <li>Enterprises must adhere to legal and regulatory requirements specific to their
                industry and location."</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>That's pretty wordy, but it's hard to find something that's not important. There are actually
        a few items I'd add to the list. Although not usually articulated, I've found the following
        to be applicable to nearly every enterprise I've worked with:
        <ul>
            <li>A mistake can be costly to many different people and teams.</li>
            <li>The appetite for these sorts of mistakes is low or nonexistent.</li>
            <li>Enterprises are highly complex (i.e. nobody understands the entire thing;
                many employees aren't truly sure of where the most revenue comes from).</li>
            <li>The yearly budget drives nearly every decision.</li>
            <li>Workers / employees have no meaningful ownership stake in the company.</li>
            <li>Most employees work for it for a limited period of time, and then usually
                move on to another enterprise.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Risk aversion, complexity, hierarchy, and budget strongly impact all software decisions
        within an enterprise. That's one of the reasons it's important to differentiate enterprise
        software development from other types of software development.</p>

    <h2>What are Enterprise Software Developers?</h2>
    <p>So what are the characteristics of an enterprise software developer? Naturally, it can
        differ from company to company, however, in general, I've found that some attributes apply
        more often than not.<br/><br/>
        Generally speaking, enterprise software developers are:
        <ul>
            <li>Professional</li>
            <li>Specialized</li>
            <li>Tolerant of administrative tasks and overhead</li>
            <li>Willing to accept significant restrictions on what they're allowed to do</li>
            <li>Generally bought in to what the enterprise is doing</li>
            <li>Well compensated</li>
            <li>Eager to maintain a set of skills that make employment at other companies possible</li>
            <li>Motivated to climb the corporate ladder (or jump to another, similar company)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>As you can imagine, enterprise software isn't for everyone. In fact, I've run into a number
        of professionals who have experienced corporate life, and quickly decided that it's not
        a match for them. Nonetheless, the aforementioned traits and attributes will help shape the
        articles and topics I explore within this site.</p>

    <h2>Fine. But who are you?</h2>
    <p>With all that in place, I suppose one remaining question exists: Why should anyone
        listen to me? I've worked with large corporations for roughly thirty years, and I've
        noticed a number of patterns that regularly present themselves.
        My hope is to elaborate upon those patterns, describe how they impact software development
        decisions, and (hopefully) provide some guidance on how to successfully navigate those patterns.</p>

    <p>There's an additional, secondary point to this site as well: There are times when the
        confines of a work day require me to provide a terse answer on a particular topic. And
        while that suffices for the moment, I end up getting follow-on questions from a few folks,
        asking me to elaborate on what drove me to make that point. I'd like to have a place where
        I can elaborate on why I feel a particular way. Then, if someone would like to hear more 
        about the topic, I can refer them to a more though-out position that I've written down.</p>

    <p>If this is the sort of thing that interests you, that's great! Welcome to this site, and I hope you find it valuable.</p>
    <p class="footnote">* Yes, it's trendy to ask ChatGPT, but I'm not going to fight the trend.
