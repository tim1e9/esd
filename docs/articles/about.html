    <h2>Why does this site exist?</h2>
    
    <p>Great, yet another site with articles about software development. Why?
        That's a very fair question. Allow me to explain...</p>

    <img class="inlineimage" src="./img/corporate1.png">

    <p>There are many different types of people who develop software, and their
        needs are very different. A bare-bones solution may be adequate for a small business,
        but may be seriously deficient for a large multinational corporation. Add in other
        types of groups, such as nonprofits, governmental organizations, hobbyists, and others,
        and the audience becomes vast. Within that vastness, there's a need for specialization.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this site is to:
        <p class="callout">Provide context and insights
        into the issues and challenges surrounding Enterprise Software Development.</p>
        <p>So while some technologies have massive
        applicability to startups, or small businesses, or even "lone wolf open source" projects,
        this site will consider the issues that most impact the enterprise software developer.</p>

    <h2>Fine. But who are you?</h2>
    <p>With all that in place, I suppose one remaining question exists: Why should anyone
        listen to me? I've worked with large corporations for roughly thirty years, and I've
        noticed a number of patterns that regularly present themselves.
        My hope is to elaborate upon those patterns, describe how they impact software development
        decisions, and (hopefully) provide some guidance on how to successfully navigate those patterns.</p>

    <p>There's an additional, secondary point to this site as well: There are times when the
        confines of a work day require me to provide a terse answer on a particular topic. And
        while that suffices for the moment, I end up getting follow-on questions from a few folks,
        asking me to elaborate on what drove me to make that point. I'd like to have a place where
        I can elaborate on why I feel a particular way. Then, if someone would like to hear more 
        about the topic, I can refer them to a more though-out position that I've written down.</p>

    <p>If this is the sort of thing that interests you, that's great! Welcome to this site,
        and I hope you find it valuable.</p>
