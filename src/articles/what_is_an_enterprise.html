    <h2>What's an Enterprise?</h2>
    <p>As previously stated, this site is all about Enterprise Software Development (ESD). So before
    diving into the details, I suppose the first question is this: <i>What exactly is an enterprise</i>?</p>

    <img class="inlineimage" src="./img/corporate1.png">
    
    <p>According to ChatGPT<sup>*</sup>, "An enterprise, in the context of business and economics, typically
        refers to a large and complex organization or corporation engaged in commercial, industrial,
        or professional activities. Enterprises are characterized by their size, scope, and structure,
        and they can encompass a wide range of industries and sectors.
        <ul>
            <li>Enterprises are structured organizations with defined hierarchies, departments, and
                specialized roles. They often have various levels of management, including executives,
                managers, and employees, organized to efficiently operate and manage the business.</li>
            <li>Enterprises often have a significant presence in the markets they serve. They may
                have a large customer base, brand recognition, and a wide geographic reach, potentially
                operating on a national or global scale.</li>
            <li>Due to their size and scope, enterprises typically require substantial resources,
                including financial capital, human resources, infrastructure, and technology, to
                support their operations.</li>
            <li>Enterprises typically have well-defined strategic goals and objectives aimed at
                achieving long-term growth, profitability, and sustainability. These goals often guide
                their decision-making processes and investments.</li>
            <li>Given their size and complexity, enterprises often have comprehensive risk management
                practices in place to identify, assess, and mitigate various risks that could impact
                their operations, reputation, or financial stability.</li>
            <li>Enterprises must adhere to legal and regulatory requirements specific to their
                industry and location."</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>That's pretty wordy, but it's hard to find something that's not important. There are actually
        a few items I'd add to the list. Although not usually articulated, I've found the following
        to be applicable to nearly every enterprise I've worked with:
        <ul>
            <li>A mistake can be costly to many different people and teams.</li>
            <li>The appetite for these sorts of mistakes is low or nonexistent.</li>
            <li>Enterprises are highly complex (i.e. nobody understands the entire thing;
                many employees aren't truly sure of where the most revenue comes from).</li>
            <li>The yearly budget drives nearly every decision.</li>
            <li>Workers / employees have no meaningful ownership stake in the company.</li>
            <li>Most employees work for it for a limited period of time, and then usually
                move on to another enterprise.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Risk aversion, complexity, hierarchy, and budget strongly impact all software decisions
        within an enterprise. That's one of the reasons it's important to differentiate enterprise
        software development from other types of software development.</p>

    <p>Wait, that's it? I knew most of that already. <i>Are you trying to waste my time?</i> Not at all.
        However, before diving into the details, it's important to understand the context for
        future articles. In fact, you can think of this article as a "North Star" - much like a 
        software project has an MVP statement (or project charter, or Statement of Work, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>So with this context now in place, it's time to describe the characteristics of an
        enterprise software developer.

        All aboard the ChatGPT bandwagon! ;-)
