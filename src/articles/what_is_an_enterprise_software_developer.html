    <h2>Enterprise IT and Enterprise Development</h2>

    <p>Now that I've outlined what's meant by an Enterprise, it's possible to describe the characteristics
        of an enterprise's approach to information technology. As with a prior article, ChatGPT provides
        an excellent starting point of what's meant by Enterprise IT:
    </p>
    <p> "Enterprise IT refers to the comprehensive set of technologies, practices, and infrastructure
        used by large organizations to manage their information systems and support their business operations."
    </p>        
    
    <p>Furthermore, Enterprise IT tends to concern itself with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Managing the hardware, software, and networks for both on-premises data centers, as
            well as cloud-based systems.</li>
        <li>Determining when to build custom software, and when to procure an existing, off-the-shelf
            solution.</li>
        <li>Managing the complete lifecycle of software development.</li>
        <li>Scaling flagship systems to support millions of users worldwide, while simultaneously
            supporting internally-facing applications for thousands of users.</li>
        <li>Governance, Privacy, and Compliance with all applicable laws in the countries
            where they conduct business.</li>
        <li>Active participation in yearly financial planning to ensure sufficient funding is
            available - even for projects that don't generate revenue.</li>
        <li>Listening to the business and proactively altering the portfolio of systems to
            best support the community of users.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As you can see, the scope of the IT department is significantly more vast than simply
        developing new software applications. However, it's valuable to understand this environment,
        because an enterprise's software development projects must live within this ecosystem.
    </p>

    <h2>What are Enterprise Software Developers?</h2>
    
    <p>So what are the characteristics of an enterprise software developer? Naturally, it can
        differ from company to company, however, in general, I've found that some attributes apply
        more often than not.<br/><br/>
        Generally speaking, enterprise software developers are:
        <ul>
            <li>Professional</li>
            <li>Specialized</li>
            <li>Tolerant of administrative tasks and overhead</li>
            <li>Willing to accept significant restrictions on what they're allowed to do</li>
            <li>Generally bought in to what the enterprise is doing</li>
            <li>Well compensated</li>
            <li>Eager to maintain a set of skills that make employment at other companies possible</li>
            <li>Motivated to climb the corporate ladder (or jump to another, similar company)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>One more item is worth noting at this point: As you can imagine, enterprise software isn't for
        everyone. In fact, I've run into a number
        of professionals who have experienced corporate life, and quickly decided that it's not
        a match for them. Nonetheless, the aforementioned traits and attributes will help shape the
        articles and topics I explore within this site.</p>
