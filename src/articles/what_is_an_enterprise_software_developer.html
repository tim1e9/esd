    <h2>What are Enterprise Software Developers?</h2>
    
    <p>So what are the characteristics of an enterprise software developer? Naturally, it can
        differ from company to company, however, in general, I've found that some attributes apply
        more often than not.<br/><br/>
        Generally speaking, enterprise software developers are:
        <ul>
            <li>Professional</li>
            <li>Specialized</li>
            <li>Tolerant of administrative tasks and overhead</li>
            <li>Willing to accept significant restrictions on what they're allowed to do</li>
            <li>Generally bought in to what the enterprise is doing</li>
            <li>Well compensated</li>
            <li>Eager to maintain a set of skills that make employment at other companies possible</li>
            <li>Motivated to climb the corporate ladder (or jump to another, similar company)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>As you can imagine, enterprise software isn't for everyone. In fact, I've run into a number
        of professionals who have experienced corporate life, and quickly decided that it's not
        a match for them. Nonetheless, the aforementioned traits and attributes will help shape the
        articles and topics I explore within this site.</p>
