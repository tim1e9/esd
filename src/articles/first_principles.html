12 factor
DRY


ESD Essentials: (aka Enterprise Developer First Principles)
---------------
Must haves:
- Project Charter / SOW / Contract / MVP Statement
- Local development
- Local Debugging
- Source code management
- Peer-reviewed code merges
- Robust, but limited unit tests
- Integrated linter
- CI/CD
- Auditable code promotion
- Environment-specific config 
- Can install tooling w/o seeking permission from mgmt
- Integration tests
- High quality reqdme files
- A minimal set of accurate arch docs
- Must be auditable and testable

Maybe:
- Autidable list of libraries used
- Performance testing (depends on project)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Solution must be available in many "places" (e.g. AWS/GCP/Azure/OnPrem), or must be truly unique

How do I deploy new/changed things without breaking my existing system (or corrupting data)?
